            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>The third volume in J.R.R. Tolkien's epic adventure THE LORD OF THE RINGS</p>
            <p>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</p>
            <p>As the Shadow of Mordor grows across the land, the Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, has joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and takes part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by Orcs, escape into Fangorn Forest and there encounter the Ents. Gandalf has miraculously returned and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Sam has left his master for dead after a battle with the giant spider, Shelob; but Frodo is still alive-now in the foul hands of the Orcs. And all the while the armies of the Dark Lord are massing as the One Ring draws ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom.</p>

            <h3>Review #1</h3>
            <p>Oh my gosh, this is an amazing end to a perfect trilogy!! J.R.R. Tolkien was very very thorough in writing these!! I've started reading the Simirillian and can't wait to finish it!! I love that Sam entity eventually goes to the undying lands and that Legolas and Gimli both go to the undying lands together. I love the friendship and unity in these books. Amazing!!</p>
