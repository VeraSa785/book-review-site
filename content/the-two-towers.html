            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin -- alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. </p>

            <h3>Review #1</h3>
            <p>The company of the Ring has been dispersed—by deception, orcs, and the lure of power. Frodo and Sam have begun the arduous journey to Mordor. Merry and Pippin are captured by orcs who are under orders to keep the Halflings alive and unsearched, and bring them to the wizard Saruman in Isengard. Gandalf was lost at the bridge of Khazad Dûm in the mines of Moria battling an ancient, mighty evil. While searching for the captured hobbits, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas cross paths with the riders of Rohan, the great horsemen of the Riddermark, whose king’s mind is shadowed by a devious counselor.</p>
            <p>A new cast of creatures and characters will reveal themselves—some as guides, some as hindrances—to what remains of the fellowship. But always there remains hope, even during the mighty battle at Helm’s Deep, a premonition of the wars that have been and remain to be fought in Gondor, who yet requires the aid of more than just men.</p>
            <p>The Two Towers is the second book in the Lord of the Rings, filled with gripping action, wondrous scenery, and deeper revelations of the characters of men when tempted with great power. This book is perfect for fans of suspenseful, epic fantasy adventures.</p>

            <h3>Review #2</h3>
            <p>This is one of my most beloved books!!! If you are a Tolkien fan or a fiction/fantasy fan in general, find some free time and start reading this!!! This is a wonderful continuation of the events of The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part in this epic story. In this book, every time the good side is victorious, you feel victorious too. Those who believe or write the negative one-star and two-star reviews on this book or any work of Tolkien's obviously don't know what good fiction means. Intensely moving, positively thrilling, and incredibly inspiring, this book is certain to add a little touch of excitement and action to your day (for those who DO KNOW what good fiction is).</p>
