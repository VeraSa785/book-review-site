            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>When Thorin Oakenshield and his band of dwarves embark upon a dangerous quest to reclaim the hoard of gold stolen from them by the evil dragon Smaug, Gandalf the wizard suggests an unlikely accomplice: Bilbo Baggins, an unassuming Hobbit dwelling in peaceful Hobbiton. </p>
            <p>Along the way, the company faces trolls, goblins, giant spiders, and worse. But as they journey from the wonders of Rivendell to the terrors of Mirkwood and beyond, Bilbo will find that there is more to him than anyone—himself included—ever dreamed. Unexpected qualities of courage and cunning, and a love of adventure, propel Bilbo toward his great destiny . . . a destiny that waits in the dark caverns beneath the Misty Mountains, where a twisted creature known as Gollum jealously guards a precious magic ring.</p>

            <h3>Review #1</h3>
            <p>This lord of the rings book set is beautiful! The books are small, and the covers of the books are firm but bendy, which will be great for taking on the go, and they have a soft, smooth, leathery feel to them. The box they come in is the same soft, leather type feeling and very sturdy. The pages are VERY thin, it's almost like the pages of a christian bible but the pages are soft with a paper like feel and not shiny like they are in a bible. The text is VERY VERY small but you can definitely still read them pretty easily maybe not for too long tho, my eyes did get tired after the first chapter from straining to read the small text which is just wrong on so many levels cause I WANT TO KEEP READING LOL!!! This is the first time I'm reading the LOTR series and I'm so already captured by the flow of the story and the detail that went into creating this wonderful world! Thank you J. R. R. Tolkien!!! From someone who is new to this series this is the complete book set. The first is The Hobbit then the next three books is actually considered only one book: The Lord Of The Rings, and this is supposed to be the sequel to The Hobbit from what I have gathered. LOTR was broken up into three books due an apparent paper shortage in the 50's when the books came out, each book of the last three here actually contains 2 books inside: The Fellowship of the Ring with book 1-the ring sets out and book 2-the ring goes south, The Two Towers with book 3-the treason of isengard and book 4-the ring goes east and last The Return of the King with book 5-the war of the ring and book 6-the end of the third age. On that note this is definitely a deluxe feeling set and worth the almost $30 dollars I paid! GREAT price for what you get!</p>
